# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

The tweeter app is a simple copy of the well known Twitter (aka X) but with really basic functions like
  - add a tweet
  - validation of tweet length
  - the list of tweets
  - the new tweets are added on the top of the tweets
  - teweets has timestamp when the tweet is added
